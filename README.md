## Abstract

Life courses become increasingly complex and determine inequalities in outcomes between groups. However, research often decomposes group gaps in life-course-sensitive outcomes based on a selective set of life course summary measures, such as the years spent in (full-time) employment. One example of group-specific outcomes is the Gender Pension Gap. In my dissertation I developed and applied two innovative combinations of methods: i) sequence analysis with the Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, as well as ii) the Life Course Feature Selection with the √ëopo decomposition. This talk guides through the practical application of both and presents the methodological and substantial contributions of both approaches that can be easily applied to other life-course-sensitive group inequalities.

## About the Instructor

Carla Rowold is a PhD candidate in Sociology at the University of Oxford and a postdoctoral researcher at the Max-Planck-Institute for Demographic Research. In her dissertation, she explores life-course- and gender-sensitive approaches to assess the link between gender inequalities over the life course and the Gender Pension Gap. Her research interests cover life course sociology and inequalities, particularly among genders, social demography, and work-family and retirement policies.
